Here are the detailed notes for **Bind attribute, ViewBag, IFormCollection, and TempData** in ASP.NET Core:

---

## **1) `[Bind]` Attribute**
📌 **Purpose:** Controls which properties of a model are bound in an action method.

### **Usage:**
- Prevent overposting attacks by specifying only the properties that should be bound.
- Useful when working with form data submissions.

### **Example:**
```csharp
public IActionResult SaveQuiz([Bind("QuizName, TotalQuestions, QuizDate")] QuizModel model)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        // Only "QuizName", "TotalQuestions", and "QuizDate" will be bound from the request
        return RedirectToAction("QuizList");
    }
    return View(model);
}
```
✅ **Only binds the specified properties** (`QuizName`, `TotalQuestions`, `QuizDate`).  
✅ Prevents overposting of sensitive data (e.g., `UserID`, `Role`).

---

## **2) `ViewBag`**
📌 **Purpose:** Passes data from the controller to the view dynamically (without needing a strongly-typed model).  
📌 **Scope:** Works only within the same request (doesn't persist between redirects).  

### **Usage:**
```csharp
public IActionResult QuizList()
{
    ViewBag.Message = "Welcome to the Quiz List!";
    return View();
}
```

### **Access in View (`.cshtml`):**
```html
<h2>@ViewBag.Message</h2>
```

✅ **Flexible (no need to define properties in the model)**  
❌ **Not type-safe (prone to errors if mistyped)**  

---

## **3) `IFormCollection`**
📌 **Purpose:** Retrieves form values from an HTTP request when **model binding is not used**.  
📌 **Scope:** Used in POST actions when handling form data manually.  

### **Example:**
```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult SaveQuiz(IFormCollection form)
{
    string quizName = form["QuizName"];
    int totalQuestions = Convert.ToInt32(form["TotalQuestions"]);

    // Process the form data manually
    return RedirectToAction("QuizList");
}
```

✅ Useful for dynamic forms where model binding is **not** ideal.  
❌ Less structured and harder to maintain than model binding.

---

## **4) `TempData`**
📌 **Purpose:** Stores data **temporarily** between two requests (useful for redirections).  
📌 **Scope:** **Persists across redirects** but is **deleted after being read once**.  

### **Usage:**
```csharp
public IActionResult DeleteQuiz(int QuizID)
{
    // Perform deletion logic
    TempData["SuccessMessage"] = "Quiz deleted successfully!";
    return RedirectToAction("QuizList");
}
```

### **Access in View (`.cshtml`):**
```html
@if (TempData["SuccessMessage"] != null)
{
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        @TempData["SuccessMessage"]
    </div>
}
```

✅ **Persists across redirects (unlike ViewBag)**  
✅ **Good for success/error messages after actions**  
❌ **Data is lost after being accessed once**

### **Notes on `[Bind]`, `ViewBag`, `IFormCollection`, and `TempData`**

1. **`[Bind]`**  
   - **Purpose:** Controls which properties are bound in an action.  
   - **Scope:** Per request.  
   - **Persists Across Redirects?** ❌ No.  
   - **Usage Example:** `[Bind("Name, Age")]`  

2. **`ViewBag`**  
   - **Purpose:** Passes data from the controller to the view.  
   - **Scope:** Per request.  
   - **Persists Across Redirects?** ❌ No.  
   - **Usage Example:** `ViewBag.Message = "Hello"`  

3. **`IFormCollection`**  
   - **Purpose:** Retrieves form values manually.  
   - **Scope:** Per request.  
   - **Persists Across Redirects?** ❌ No.  
   - **Usage Example:** `form["QuizName"]`  

4. **`TempData`**  
   - **Purpose:** Stores data between requests.  
   - **Scope:** Temporary (until read).  
   - **Persists Across Redirects?** ✅ Yes.  
   - **Usage Example:** `TempData["Message"] = "Success"`
