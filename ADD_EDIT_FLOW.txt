1️⃣ Insert (New Quiz)
✅ When a new quiz is created, QuizId == 0.
✅ The method does not set @QuizID because the database will auto-generate it.
✅ It calls the "PR_MST_Quiz_Insert" stored procedure.

Example Scenario:
The user fills out a form with quiz details and clicks "Save".
Since it’s a new quiz, QuizId == 0, so PR_MST_Quiz_Insert is executed.
The database automatically generates a new QuizID (Primary Key).



Flow:
User clicks "Add Quiz" → QuizId is 0.
The system runs "PR_MST_Quiz_Insert" (inserts new quiz).
The database assigns a new unique QuizID.
The user is redirected to QuizList.



2️⃣ Update (Editing an Existing Quiz)
✅ When editing a quiz, QuizId > 0 (already exists in DB).
✅ The method adds @QuizID as a parameter to update the correct record.
✅ It calls "PR_MST_Quiz_Update" to modify an existing quiz.

Example Scenario:
The user edits an existing quiz with QuizId = 5.
Since QuizId > 0, the system runs "PR_MST_Quiz_Update".
The database updates the quiz with ID = 5 instead of creating a new one.

Flow:
User selects a quiz with QuizId = 5 and clicks "Edit".
The system runs "PR_MST_Quiz_Update" with QuizId = 5.
The existing quiz is updated with new values.
The user is redirected to QuizList.


Summary
Scenario	  QuizId Value	Command Executed	What Happens?
Insert (New Quiz)	0	"PR_MST_Quiz_Insert"	Adds a new quiz, DB generates QuizId.
Update (Edit Quiz)	> 0	"PR_MST_Quiz_Update"	Updates existing quiz using QuizId.


Key Takeaways
Insert happens when QuizId == 0, so a new quiz is created, and the database assigns an ID.
Update happens when QuizId > 0, so an existing quiz is modified.
The database handles QuizID for new inserts (usually with IDENTITY(1,1) in SQL Server).
The user does NOT manually enter QuizID, it's either:
Auto-generated for new quizzes.
Retrieved from the database for edits.
